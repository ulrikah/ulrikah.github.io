    <h1>Peers</h1>

    <code> peers </code> is an application for peer-to-peer multi-user video and
    audio streaming over WebRTC. It was developed fall 2020 to learn about
    WebRTC and to investigate the latency limitations of "na√Øve" multi-user P2P
    communication when scaling up the number of participants.

    <p>
        The platform is <a href="https://handshakers.herokuapp.com/"
            >running on Heroku</a
        >. Currently, there is only one room to join. If you want to test it you
        can do so by opening a connection to yourself on two different devices,
        or invite a friend to join. The platform doesn't require any
        authentication, so the link above is, in theory, the only thing you need
        to connect.
